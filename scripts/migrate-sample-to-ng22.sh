# Copies the six scaffolding files from helloworld, then restores the three per-sample values that
# must NOT be shared: the federation container name (REMOTE_NAME), the npm package name, and the
# description. The only files it touches under src/app/** are the two dev-shell files app.module.ts
# and app.component.ts, which it DELETES — a Native Federation remote has no standalone dev shell.
# Everything else under src/app/** is the sample's own code and is left alone. Point this at a real
# extension whose app.module.ts holds production code and you WILL lose it; move that code out first.
#
# REMOTE_NAME is read from the sample's OWN manifest (frontend.remote.remoteName) rather than from
# its webpack.config.js, so this still works if the Webpack config was already removed. A duplicate
# container name across two installed extensions makes the second alias to the first at runtime.
